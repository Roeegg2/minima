## Prologue

In this blog/series I will try to give an introduction to the NES architecture, directed to new emu devs looking to get started.

The NES has 4 major components:
The _CPU_, the _PPU_, the _APU_, _Cartridge & Mappers_, and the _Main Bus_.

- [**CPU** - Chapter 1](/nes-internals/cpu)

- [**PPU Background** - Chapter 2](/nes-internals/ppu-background)

- [**PPU Foreground** - Chapter 3](/nes-internals/ppu-foreground)

- [**Cartridge & Mappers** - Chapter 4](/nes-internals/cart-and-mappers)

- [**Controls** - Chapter 5](/nes-internals/controls)

I do plan to write about the rest of the components as well in the future.

## Disclaimer

This is not meant to be a substitute to documentation or anything like that. I try to provide simple explanation to each of the NES's components, to make it easier to understand the NESdev wiki.

I'm not a professional by any means, and I still much more to learn. All the stuff written here is what I've learned and understood in my journey of writing an NES emulator.
